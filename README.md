# Yoable

**Yoable** is an AI-powered image annotation tool designed to make dataset labeling faster and more efficient. It supports **YOLO v5/v8 (ONNX)** models for automatic object detection and labeling. Yoable provides an intuitive interface for managing images, running AI-assisted labeling, and exporting labels in a format compatible with machine learning models.

For non-WPF version you can build the legacy source or use v1.2.0 from releases - [Legacy branch](https://github.com/Babyhamsta/Yoable/tree/legacy).

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

### Importing Images
- Click **"Import Image"** or **"Import Directory"** to load images.
- The images will appear in the **image list**.
- Use the scroll wheel to navigate through the imported images.

### Applying Labels
- **Manual Labeling**: Use the drawing tools to create bounding boxes.
- **AI Auto-Labeling**: Click **"Auto Label Images"** to apply AI detections.

### Managing Labels
- Labels appear in the **label list**.
- Click on a label to edit it.
- Press **Delete** to remove selected labels.
- Use arrow keys for precise label movement.

### Importing & Exporting Labels
- **Import Labels**: Load existing YOLO-format label files.
- **Export Labels**: Save labeled data in YOLO format.
- **Cloud Upload (Optional)**: When exporting, users are asked if they want to upload their dataset. This can be disabled in settings.

### Updating Yoable
- Yoable automatically checks for updates.
